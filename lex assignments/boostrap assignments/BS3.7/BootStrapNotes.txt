[Demo:BSD2.html]

Responsive images
++++++++++++++++++
Bootstrap 3 allows to make the images responsive by adding a class .img-responsive 
to the <img> tag. This class applies max-width: 100%; and height: auto; to the 
image so that it scales nicely to the parent element.

	<img src="..." class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image">
	
List
++++
Bootstrap supports ordered lists, unordered lists, and definition lists

[Demo:BSD3.html]

Tables
++++++
Bootstrap provides a clean layout for building tables using .table class

[Demo:BSD4.html]

By wrapping any .table in .table-responsive class, you will make the table scroll 
horizontally up to small devices

[Demo:BSD5.html]

Grid
++++
	Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that 
	appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases. 
	It includes predefined classes for easy layout options, as well as powerful 
	mixins for generating more semantic layouts
	
	Mobile First Strategy
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Content-Determine what is most important.

    Layout-Design to smaller widths first.Base CSS address mobile device first;media 
	queries address for tablet,desktops.

    Progressive Enhancement-Add elements as screen size increases.
	
	[Demo:BSD6.html]

	How Bootstrap grid works
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    *Rows must be placed within a .container class for proper alignment and padding.
    *Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns.
    *Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows.
    *Predefined grid classes like .row and .col-xs-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts.
    *Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in 
	rows for the first and last column via negative margin on .rows.
    *Grid columns are created by specifying the number of twelve available columns you wish to span.
	
	[Demo:BSD7-9.html]

	Nesting columns
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	To nest your content with the default grid, add a new .row and set of .col-md-* columns within 
	an existing .col-md-* column. Nested rows should include a set of columns that add up to 12.
	
	[Demo:BSD10.html]
	
	Column Reordering
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Columns can be reordered using using .col-md-push-* and .col-md-pull-* classes.
